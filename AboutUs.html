<h1> About Us </h1>
<p> The Sta. Elena High School Mathematics Club is a Club who simply enjoy learning and exploring math together. We meet to practice challenging problems, help one another with lessons, and discover new ideas beyond the classroom. </p>

<p> Our goal is to make math easier, more enjoyable, and something everyone can feel confident about. Whether you’re good at numbers or just trying to improve, the Math Club is a place where you can ask questions, learn at your own pace, and be supported by friends. </p>

<p> We believe that math isn’t just a subject, it’s a skill that can open doors, build discipline, and inspire creativity. In the Sta. Elena Math Club, we grow, learn, and solve problems together.</p>
